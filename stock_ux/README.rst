Stock UX
========

Several improvements to stock:

#. Add new field "Net Quantity" on stock moves lines only visible when you filter by locations. This fields is computed this way:

    #. If filtered location is found on source location: use negative quantity
    #. If filtered location is found on destiny location: use positive quantity
    #. If filtered location is found on source and destiny location: use 0
#. When accesing stock moves lines throw products group by picking type and todo
#. Add to orderpoint Rotation and Location Rotation: delivered quantities to customers on last 90 days divided per 3 (to make it monthly)
#. Add button "Set all Done" on Moves lines
#. Add observations on pickings (and deliveryslip)
#. Add tracking field and Messaging in "Stock Warehouse Orderpoint".
#. Add partner field on procurement group form view.
#. Add button on moves to destination pickings
#. We create a new group "Allow picking cancellation", only users with that right can cancel pickings or validate without back orders
#. Add in the picking return wizard a field with the reason for the return and then bring that field to internal notes in the created picking.
#. Only allow to delete pickings on draft/cancel state.
#. Add a wizard accion in Operation to change locations.
#. Remove the technical features group in the "Forecasted" button from the product template view, to see the breakdown of incoming and outgoing stock.
#. Fix in the calculation cost of the merchandise sold when the currency of the product is different from the currency of the company.
#. Add a stock picking list report to stock pickings.
#. Add compatibility with web_m2x_options by allowing to create lots on m2o fields
#. Remove tecnical features to Stock moves menu in inventory/reports.
#. Add in products (template and variants) button to access to stock moves related.
#. Change name to the menus Product Move and Product Move lines.
#. Add to "To Do" filter in stock move the state "partially_available".
#. Add optional constraints configurable by Picking Type:

* Block Picking Edit: Restrict to add lines or to send more quantity than the original quantity. This will only apply to users with group Restrict Edit Blocked Pickings.

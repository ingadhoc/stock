Stock UX
========

#. Add button "Set all Done" on moves lines in the picking
#. Add observations on pickings (and deliveryslip)
#. Add a wizard action in the stock move lines of a picking to change locations for several lines at the same time.
#. Show always visible (for an existing lots configuration in the type operation) the notebook pages in lot form view when create and edit a lot from a stock move line.
#. Add  reason return field in the picking return wizard and then bring that field to internal notes in the created picking.
#. Add a stock picking list report to stock pickings.
#. Add an optional setting to print in Delivery Slip reports the origin description instead of the product name.
#. We create a new group "Allow picking cancellation", only users with that right can cancel pickings or validate without back orders
#. Only allow to delete pickings on draft/cancel state.
#. Change the name of the menus "Moves History" to "Products Moves Detailed" and "Product Move lines".
#. Remove technical features to Stock Moves menu in Inventory>Reports.
#. Add new field ""Net Quantity"" on stock moves lines. When you filter by locations, the field will be computed this way:
      1. If filtered location is found on source location: use negative quantity.
      2. If filtered location is found on destiny location: use positive quantity.
      3. If filtered location is found on source and destiny location: use "0".
#. Add in products (template and variants) a button to access to stock moves related.
#. When accesing stock moves through the products form group by picking type and filter according to do.
#. Add Rotation and Location Rotation to Reordering Rules (orderpoint): delivered quantities to customers on last 120 days divided per 4 (to make it monthly)
#. Add optional constraints configurable by Picking Type
#. Add partner field on procurement group form view.

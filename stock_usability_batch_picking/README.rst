=====================================================
Stock Usability with Batch Picking and stock vouchers
=====================================================

#. For now, make batch proccessing only available for incoming
#. Add integration with stock voucher so you can introduce voucher number on the batch
#. Add picking origin field on operations
#. Restrict picking validation only if at least one operation has done quantity (default behaviour of validating everything is confusing)
#. Alert user when cancelling a batch that all pickings are going to be cancelled
#. We deactivate create batch picking from pickings (TODO: por ahora es manual)
#. Add print button from picking tree view on batchs

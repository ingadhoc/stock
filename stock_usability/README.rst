Stock Usability Improvements
============================

Several improovements to stock:
#. Make partner visible also in internal transfers (required to print valid stock vouchers when moving products between warehouses)
#. Add on stock moves Picking Creator and Picking Partner (last one already exsits but we make it stored)
#. Allow to filter and group by type of picking type on moves (internal, outgoing and incoming)
#. Add new field "Net Quantity" on stock moves only visible when you filter by locations. This fields is computed this way:
    *. If filtered location is found on source location: use negative quantity
    *. If filtered location is found on destiny location: use positive quantity
    *. If filtered location is found on source and destiny location: use 0
#. When accesing stock moves throw products group by picking type and todo
#. Add to orderpoint Rotation and Location Rotation: delivered quantities to customers on last 90 days divided per 3 (to make it monthly)
#. On draft pickings, if you change source or target locations, related moves will be update accordingly (by default they where not updated).
#. Block change of picking type in other state than 'draft'
#. Add button "Set all Done" on pack operations
#. Make moves visible on pickings no matter the state
#. Add tracking field and Messaging in "Stock Warehouse Orderpoint".
#. Add new button "cancell remaining" on procurements
#. Add partner field on procurement group form view. Also allow to search procurements by group
#. Add button on moves to destination pickings
#. We create a new group "Allow picking cancellation", only users with that right can cancel pickings or validate without back orders
#. Add in the pikcing return wizard a field with the reason for the return and then bring that field to internal notes in the created picking.
#. Backport from 10 of fix on domain of "Products" filter in Products search view.
#. Only allow to delete pickings on draft/cancel state.
#. Add a wizard accion in Operation to change locations.
#. Remove the group Tecnical Features to the seccion "Locations" in "stock move" form view from the picking view.
